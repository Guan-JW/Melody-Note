;;; specify time signature default settings

;;; format:
;;;
;;; alist of
;;;   (time-signature . default-properties) entries.
;;;
;;; where default-properties is an alist containing information about the
;;; time signature.  Each default-properties set can contain the
;;; following entries:
;;;
;;;   (baseMoment . (numerator . denominator))
;;;   (beatStructure . structure-list)
;;;   (beamExceptions . (alist of beam exceptions that don't follow beats))
;;;
;;; The alist of beam exceptions has the following entries:
;;;
;;;   (end . grouping-rules)
;;;   (subdivide . grouping-rules)  (not yet implemented, reserved for future use)
;;;
;;;   grouping-rules is an alist containing (beam-type . grouping-list) entries
;;;
;;;     beam-type is (numerator . denominator)
;;;     grouping-list is a list that specifies the
;;;     number of stems of the given duration that are grouped in a beamed unit.
;;;     For an exception, the duration used is beam-type.  For measureBeats,
;;;     the duration used is baseMoment.
;;;
;;;     If an exception is specified for a given beam-type, it will apply to all
;;;     beams of shorter durations that don't have an individual exception, so
;;;     ((1 . 8) . (3 3 2))
;;;     will cause all primary beams to be broken at 3/8, 6/8, and 8/8.
;;;
;;;     ((1 . 32) . (16 8 4 4))
;;;     will cause all 1/32, 1/64, and 1/128 beams to be broken at 1/2, 3/4,
;;;     7/8, and 8/8.
;;;
;;; If no values are given for baseMoment and measureBeats, default values
;;;   will be assigned:
;;;   baseMoment gets the value (ly:make-moment 1  time-signature-denominator)
;;;   beatStructure gets a list of (3 3 3 ...), where the number of entries is the
;;;     number of beats, each containing 3 base-moments, if the time
;;;     signature numerator is greater than 3 and divisible by 3, and
;;;     a list of (1 1 1 ...), where the number of entries is the
;;;     number of base moments in a measure otherwise.
;;;
;;;       NOTE: numerator is kept in beam-type because of
;;;             tuplets, e.g. (2 . 24) = (2 . 3) * (1 . 8)
;;;             for eighth-note triplets.
