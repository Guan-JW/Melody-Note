  "Make a harp pedal diagram.

Possible elements in @var{definition-string}:

@table @code
@item ^
pedal is up
@item -
pedal is neutral
@item v
pedal is down
@item |
vertical divider line
@item o
the following pedal should be circled (indicating a change)
@end table

The function also checks if the string has the typical form of three
pedals, then the divider and then the remaining four pedals.  If not it
prints out a warning.  However, in any case, it will also print each symbol
in the order as given.  This means you can place the divider (even
multiple dividers) anywhere you want, but you'll have to live with the
warnings.

The appearance of the diagram can be tweaked inter alia using the size property
of the TextScript grob (@code{\\override Voice.TextScript #'size = #0.3}) for
the overall, the thickness property (@code{\\override Voice.TextScript
#'thickness = #3}) for the line thickness of
the horizontal line and the divider.  The remaining configuration (box
sizes, offsets and spaces) is done by the harp-pedal-details list of
properties (@code{\\override Voice.TextScript #'harp-pedal-details
#'box-width = #1}).
It contains the following settings: @code{box-offset} (vertical shift
of the box center for up/down pedals), @code{box-width},
@code{box-height}, @code{space-before-divider} (the spacing between
two boxes before the divider) and @code{space-after-divider} (box
spacing after the divider).
