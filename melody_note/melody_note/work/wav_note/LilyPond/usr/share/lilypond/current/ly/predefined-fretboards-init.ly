% chord-shape-table is a hash-table of chord shapes
% in the form of diagram-descriptions that can be
% fret-diagram-verbose markup-llsts or
% fret-diagram-terse strings.
% The hash keys are pairs of scheme symbols and
% string tunings.  For convenience, the symbols in
% this file are LilyPond chordmode chord descriptions,
% but that is unnecessary.
